*! esrreport 1.0.0  03oct2026  A. Araar
*! Corrected 02oct2026: after svy, subpop() the reading works on the subpopulation;
*! when the Hermite controls reject with strong instruments, the route proposed
*! is the augmented two-step (method(twostep) hermite(#)), an explicit choice to
*! state; with weak instruments, the semiparametric MTE as before.
*! Reading of an esreg estimation for the practitioner (skeleton).  Runs the
*! diagnostics and tests of the family on the stored estimation, then prints an
*! ordered reading with rule-based notes: (1) the selection equation (strength,
*! form, support, index specification, sufficiency); (2) selection on gains
*! (kappa, its sign, the pseudo-DiD pattern, kappa(x)); (3) the joint law and the
*! route to retain (Hausman, gamma contrast, Hermite); (4) the effects to report
*! (full and on the common support, profile by quantile of the score).
*! The notes are statements and questions, not verdicts: the thresholds are
*! conventions, set by options, and every line names the test it rests on.
*!

*!
*!   nq(#)        quantile groups of the score for the profile of effects (default 5)
*!   lrmin(#)     LR of the excluded instruments below which they are called weak (10)
*!   vifmax(#)    VIF of lambda above which identification is called "by form" (10)
*!   extrapmax(#) share of a group outside the other's support above which the
*!                effects on the common support are recommended (0.10)
*!   alpha(#)     size of the tests in the reading (0.05)
*!   export()     write the figures and the notes to a plain-text file (the sheet
*!                an assistant, human or not, can read together with the study's
*!                context); replace overwrites
*!   notests      diagnostics and effects only (no re-estimation)
*! Returns r(route) ("fiml", "twostep", "augmented", "semipar", or "index" /
*! "instruments" when the selection equation must be fixed first), r(hermite) (the
*! order suggested for the augmented route), r(n_notes), r(note1)... and

*! r(att_cs) r(atu_cs) r(eff_first) r(eff_last).
* all program drops first: an autoloaded ado-file defines its programs only while
* it reads program definitions, so nothing else may stand between them

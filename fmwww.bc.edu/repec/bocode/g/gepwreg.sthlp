{cmd:aweight}s and {cmd:pweight}s are allowed; see {help weight}.
{cmd:fweight}s are not: a unit of a survey stands for its sampling weight,
it is not a replicated record, and the standard errors count the units;
true frequencies can be {help expand}ed first.  One rule decides which weights are used, and the header of
the output names the source in every run.  If {cmd:svyset} declares a weight
it is captured before anything is computed and used for everything -- the
step-1 coefficients, the bandwidth, the measurement-error correction, the
ranks and the variance -- and a weight expression on the command line is then
ignored, with a note.  Two declarations that can disagree would otherwise
estimate with one weight and build the design variance for the plan of
another.  The weight on the command line is used only when {cmd:svyset}
declares none; with neither, the estimation is unweighted.  {cmd:e(wtype)},
{cmd:e(wexp)} and {cmd:e(wsrc)} record what was used.{p_end}

{it:indepvars} and the {opt het()} variables may contain factor variables;
see {help fvvarlist}.  Base levels are carried in {cmd:e(b)} as zero entries
and hidden in the table.  {opt rankvar()} is the exception: it names the
variable whose rank carries the profile, which needs a single ordered scale,
so a factor-variable term is refused there.{p_end}

The post-estimation command

{cmd:gepwreg_setable} [{cmd:,} {opt naive}]

displays the consistent standard errors available after the last
estimation side by side (influence function, Taylor under a design,
bootstrap) with the ratio of the two most informative ones.  The main
table already reports the appropriate one; the comparison is a check of
the asymptotic approximation, to be run when {cmd:e(N_eff)} is small, when
few PSUs fall in a stratum, or when a category is rare in the group: a
ratio far from 1 says to read the bootstrap.  {opt naive} adds the WLS
variance with the kernel weights taken as fixed, {cmd:e(V_naive)}
({opt rankvar}, {opt rankdep}), which is inconsistent and shown only for
the replication of the comparisons of the paper.

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:gepwreg} estimates how the effect of the covariates on an outcome varies
along a distribution, with the percentile weights of Araar (2016): Gaussian
kernel weights on the percentile scale, centred at a target percentile
{it:tau}.  Version 1.5.0 estimates three objects:

{phang2}
(a) the {bf:effect at the {it:tau}-quantile of the outcome}: the mean effect
of {it:indepvars} among the units whose outcome is at the {it:tau}-quantile
of {it:depvar} (the default, and {opt het()});{p_end}

{phang2}
(b) the {bf:effect at the initial quantile}: the mean effect among the units
whose outcome {it:before} the contribution of one or more regressors,
{it:y0 = y - b_i (x - xref)}, is at the {it:tau}-quantile of {it:y0}
({opt initial()});{p_end}

{phang2}
(c) the {bf:profile of the effect along a covariate}: the effect of
{it:indepvars} among the units at the {it:tau}-quantile of an observed
variable {it:z} ({opt rankvar(z)}).{p_end}

{pstd}
Objects (a) and (b) are estimated in two steps: a unit-level effect
{it:b_i} is estimated for every unit from a model of the heterogeneity of
the effect fitted on the whole sample, and the effects are averaged with
the percentile weights on the rank of {it:y} (or of {it:y0}).  Object (c)
is the kernel-weighted regression of {it:y} on {it:x} with the weights on
the rank of {it:z}.

{pstd}
{bf:What changed in 1.4.}  Up to version 1.3, object (a) was estimated
by the kernel-weighted regression of {it:y} on {it:x} with the weights on
the rank of {it:y} itself.  That regression selects the right units but
cannot measure the effect among them: inside a window on {it:y} the
outcome does not vary, so the weighted slope converges to a fraction of
the effect that shrinks with the bandwidth and vanishes as {it:h} goes to
zero (Goldberger 1981: selection on the dependent variable).  It equals
the effect only when {it:y} is a deterministic monotone function of a
single regressor, the case of the examples of Araar (2016, 2023).  On
survey data it is attenuated by one to two orders of magnitude, and its
sign can follow the heteroskedasticity of the error rather than the
effect.  It remains available with {opt rankdep}, labelled as a descriptive
slope.  The derivation, the simulations and the Burkina Faso application
are in Araar (2026, version 3).

{pstd}
{bf:What changed in 1.5.0.}  The group at {it:tau} is defined by the outcome,
so the profile of object (a) across percentiles mixes the composition of
the group with the heterogeneity of the effect.  {opt ref()} gives the
effect for a given household, which holds the composition fixed, and
{opt graph()} draws the profile with a simultaneous band and a test that the
effect is constant across the percentiles; see
{help gepwreg##history:Version history} and Araar (2026, version 5).

{hline}
{marker methods}{...}
{title:Objects and estimators}

{pstd}
{ul:Notation.}  {it:p_i = F_n(y_i)} is the (weighted) percentile rank of
unit {it:i}; the percentile weight is

{pmore}
{it:w_i} = exp(-0.25*((p_i - tau)/h)^2) / (h * sqrt(2*pi) * n)

{pstd}
and {it:fw_i} is the sampling weight.  The group at {it:tau} is the set of
units with a large {it:w_i}; its effective size is
{it:N_eff} = (sum {it:fw_i w_i})^2 / sum ({it:fw_i w_i})^2.

{pstd}
{ul:Effect at the {it:tau}-quantile of {it:y} (default; het()).}  The
object is E[ dy/dx | y = q_tau ], the unconditional quantile partial
effect of Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2009), who show that it equals both
the mean derivative of the units at {it:q_tau} and the effect of a
marginal shift of {it:x} on the population quantile {it:q_tau}.  The
estimator is

{pmore}
theta(tau) = sum_i fw_i w_i b_i / sum_i fw_i w_i

{pstd}
where {it:b_i} is the effect of {it:x} for unit {it:i} from the
heterogeneity model of step 1.  The weights {it:w_i} on the rank of
{it:y} estimate the weight f(q_tau|x)/f(q_tau) of the FFL representation
without a conditional density.  Two heterogeneity models are offered:

{phang2}
{opt het(varlist)}: {it:y} is regressed on {it:x}, {it:z} and all the
interactions {it:x} x {it:z} on the whole sample, and
{it:b_ij} = {it:g_j} + sum_l {it:g_jl z_il}.  The estimator then has the
closed form theta_j = {it:g_j} + sum_l {it:g_jl} zbar_l(tau), where
zbar_l(tau) is the weighted mean of {it:z_l} in the group at {it:tau}:
the profile of the effect along {it:y} is the heterogeneity of the effect
times the composition of the group, and the table {cmd:e(decomp)} shows
that decomposition.  This model captures the heterogeneity that runs
through the observables {it:z}; heterogeneity ordered with {it:y} within
{it:z} is averaged out.{p_end}

{phang2}
{opt het(qr)} (the default): conditional quantile regressions of {it:y} on
{it:x} at the quantiles of {opt qgrid()}; the conditional rank {it:u_i} of
unit {it:i} is the midpoint of the two grid quantiles between which
{it:y_i} falls given {it:x_i}, and {it:b_i} is the quantile-regression
slope interpolated at {it:u_i}.  Under {it:y = h(x, e)}, {it:e}
independent of {it:x} and {it:h} increasing in {it:e}, {it:b_i} is the
unit's own derivative, and the estimator is the FFL representation of the
UQPE as the average of the conditional quantile partial effects.  This
model captures the heterogeneity ordered with {it:y} given {it:x},
observed or not; its price is the specification of the conditional
quantile function (linear in {it:x} at each quantile).{p_end}

{pstd}
The two models and the RIF regression of {helpb rifhdreg} target the same
object and can be compared: a difference between {opt het(z)} and
{opt het(qr)} signals heterogeneity ordered with {it:y} that {it:z} does
not carry.

{pstd}
{ul:Effect at the initial quantile (initial()).}  The object is
E[ b_i | y0 = q_tau(y0) ] with {it:y0_i = y_i - sum_j b_ij (x_ij - xref_j)},
the sum running over the regressors listed in {opt initial()} ({cmd:_all}
for all of them): the outcome net of their contribution at the reference
values {opt xref()}.  It answers "who benefits among the initially poor", the
question of programme evaluation (a binary {it:x} with {it:xref} = 0).
The unit-level effects of step 1 give {it:y0}, and the percentile weights
on the rank of {it:y0} give the estimator.  The object is identified by
the heterogeneity model (or by rank invariance, Heckman, Smith and Clements
1997).  {cmd:e(b_atq)} stores the effect at the quantile of {it:y} from the
same run.

{pstd}
{ul:Profile along a covariate (rankvar(z)).}  The object is
E[ b_i | rank(z) = tau ]: the effect of {it:x} for the units at the
{it:tau}-quantile of an observed {it:z} (age of the head, an asset index,
the predicted outcome {it:x'b}).  Because the weights do not involve
{it:y}, the kernel-weighted regression of {it:y} on {it:x} is a
varying-coefficient regression and estimates this object with the usual
smoothing bias; the influence-function, Taylor and bootstrap standard
errors of version 1.3 apply unchanged.

{pstd}
{ul:One-step weighted regression on outcome-ranked units (rankdep).}  The
weighted slope among units with {it:y} near {it:q_tau}.  Under joint
normality and a constant effect {it:b}, its limit is
{it:b} x [Var_w(y)/Var(y)] / [Var_w(x)/Var(x)] (Goldberger 1981), the
share of the variance of {it:y} that the kernel retains: about 1 percent
at the Silverman bandwidth.  In general its limit is of order {it:h}^2 and
carries the slope of the conditional density of {it:y} given {it:x} at
{it:q_tau}, not the effect.  No bandwidth, truncation correction,
variance correction or reweighting repairs it, because the information
about the effect is not inside a level set of {it:y}.

{hline}
{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Main}

{phang}
{opt percentile(#)} specifies the target percentile {it:tau} in (0, 1).
The default is {cmd:percentile(0.5)}.

{phang}
{opt het(varlist)} selects the heterogeneity model on observables: the
effect of each regressor is allowed to vary linearly with each variable of
{it:varlist} (interactions).  {it:varlist} may include regressors of
{it:indepvars} and factor variables.  The unit-level effect is the
derivative of the step-1 model with respect to the regressor; when a
regressor is also a {opt het()} variable, that derivative includes its own
quadratic term (d/dx of {it:d x^2} = 2{it:d x}) and the interactions of
the other regressors with it, so that the effect of household size, say,
is the full marginal effect of size and not the coefficient of one
column.  For a binary regressor (values 0 and 1) that is also a {opt het()}
variable, the effect is the difference between the model at 1 and at 0:
{it:x^2} = {it:x}, so the derivative 2{it:d x} is not identified, and the
difference, whose own term is {it:d}, is.

{phang}
{opt het(qr)} selects the conditional quantile regression as the
heterogeneity model.  This is the default when neither {opt het()},
{opt rankvar()} nor {opt rankdep} is specified.  Standard errors require
{opt boot()}.

{phang}
{opt initial(varlist|_all)} requests the effect at the {it:tau}-quantile
of the outcome before the contribution of the listed regressors (a
treatment or programme variable, typically; {cmd:_all} nets out every
regressor), {it:y0}.  Standard errors by the pairs bootstrap;
{cmd:boot(200)} is assumed when {opt boot()} is not given, and {opt boot(#)}
sets the number of replications here as everywhere else -- there is one
option for the bootstrap, not one per estimator.  The replications show the
usual progress dots, with a count at the end of each row of fifty and an
{cmd:x} in place of a dot for a replication that failed; {opt nodots}
suppresses them.  The header reports the execution time in seconds, also in
{cmd:e(etime)}, which is the direct way to see what any option costs.  It is
measured with Stata's timer 99: a value kept there across a {cmd:gepwreg}
call is cleared.

{phang}
{opt xref(numlist)} gives the reference values of the regressors used to
define {it:y0}: one per term of the coefficient table in its order (the
values on base levels are ignored), or one per non-base regressor; the
default is zero for all.

{phang}
{opt qgrid(numlist)} sets the quantiles of the step-1 quantile regressions
of {opt het(qr)}; the default is 0.05, 0.10, ..., 0.95.

{phang}
{opt ref(default | mean | var=# ...)} reports, besides the effect for the households
at {it:tau}, the effect for one {it:reference} household placed at
{it:tau}.  The effect at {it:tau} depends on who is there: the households at
the bottom and at the top of the distribution differ in their
characteristics, so the profile of {cmd:e(b)} across {it:tau} mixes the
composition of the group at {it:tau} with the heterogeneity of the effect.
The reference household holds the composition fixed.  {cmd:ref(default)} is
a real type: continuous regressors at their (weighted) mean, a 0/1 variable
at its most frequent value, a factor variable at its most frequent level --
the mean of a binary variable or of the indicators of a factor is not a
household that exists.  {cmd:ref(mean)} is the mean household in the strict
sense: every variable at its (weighted) mean, a 0/1 variable at its share and
each indicator of a factor at the share of its level -- the effect at the
means, {it:g}(E[{it:x}]); under {opt het(varlist)}, where the effect is linear
in the characteristics, it is also the average effect in the population,
E[{it:g}({it:x})], and the standard error accounts for the sampling of every
mean.  {cmd:ref(size=5 urban=1 gse=5)} gives values; a variable not named
keeps its default value (or its mean with {cmd:ref(mean size=5)}).  Main effects only (no
interaction terms); not with {opt initial()}, {opt rankvar()} or
{opt rankdep}.

{pmore}
Under {opt het(varlist)} the effect for the reference household is the
step-1 model's effect at its characteristics, {it:M}({it:x_ref}){it:gamma},
with the exact influence function (the sampling of the means that define the
reference included), the Taylor variance under a design, and the bootstrap
with {opt boot()}.  It does not depend on {it:tau}: in this model the effect
of a given household is the same wherever it stands, and the whole profile
across {it:tau} is composition.  Under {opt het(qr)} it is the slope
{it:beta}({it:u*}) of the conditional quantile regression at the rank
{it:u*} that puts the reference household at {it:q_tau}, on the grid path
interpolated in {it:u} ({cmd:e(u_ref)} reports {it:u*}).  Its standard error
is the bootstrap with {opt boot(#)}, the reference household recomputed in
every replication; without {opt boot()}, the delta method, reported with a
warning: it rests on the density of the conditional quantiles at {it:u*}
(qreg's Powell kernel), which is imprecise in finite samples, and the
estimate has a kink at every grid quantile.

{pmore}
Which object for which question.  The effect at {it:tau}, {cmd:e(b)}, is the
answer for the households that are at {it:tau} as they are, their
characteristics included: what a change of {it:x} for every household does
to the {it:tau}-quantile, the object of a universal policy and of an
indicator defined at a quantile, such as a poverty line at the first
quartile; that it carries the composition of the group is intended there.
{cmd:ref(mean)} under {opt het(varlist)} is the average effect in the
population, an aggregate benchmark, and its gap to {cmd:e(b)} is the share
of the effect at {it:tau} due to who is there.  {cmd:ref(default)} states the
result for a household that exists and, under {opt het(qr)}, answers whether
the effect of a given household changes with its position.  Values given
target a group: the type a programme is aimed at
({cmd:ref(male=0 size=8)}); a region, when it enters the model as a factor
({cmd:ref(}{it:region}{cmd:=}{it:#}{cmd:)}, one curve per region with the rest of the type held
fixed, which separates what is due to the region from what is due to who
lives there); or a typology of households whose effects feed a simulation of
a marginal change ({opt initial()} for a change large enough to re-rank the
households).  For two types side by side:{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. gepwreg lexp size male urban i.gse, per(0.25) ref(urban=0) graph(size male, ref)}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. gepwreg lexp size male urban i.gse, per(0.25) ref(urban=1) graph(size male, ref)}{p_end}

{pmore}
These are partial effects of a marginal change, with no general-equilibrium
response, under the heterogeneity model chosen: under {opt het(varlist)} the
effect varies only with the {opt het()} variables, so a reference curve that
is flat is the model's statement, not a finding; under {opt het(qr)} it
varies only with the conditional rank.  A reference outside the range of the
data extrapolates the model.

{phang}
{opt rankvar(varname)} estimates the profile of the effect along the rank
of {it:varname} by the kernel-weighted regression; {it:varname} must not be
the outcome.

{phang}
{opt rankdep} estimates the one-step weighted regression on outcome-ranked
units of version 1.3.  Its slope is a descriptive quantity, not the
effect; see {help gepwreg##methods:Objects and estimators}.

{dlgtab:Measurement error}

{phang}
{opt merr} corrects the step-1 fit of {opt het()} for classical measurement
error in the heterogeneity variables.  It is available only with
{opt het(}{it:varlist}{opt )}: the correction is a subtraction on the matrix of
second moments, which least squares provides and the check function of
{opt het(qr)} does not.

{pmore}
Why it matters.  A noisy heterogeneity variable does not simply flatten the
profile.  The composition term is untouched, because the measurement error is
independent of the rank, so the whole bias is a level shift plus a shrinkage of
the slope -- and the level shift carries the MAIN effect of the heterogeneity
variable, not its interaction.  The reported effect of {it:indepvars} can
therefore be over-stated by a factor of two to six while the interaction
coefficient looks almost right.

{pmore}
How it works.  The error variance is estimated from the sample itself, from the
third moments of the step-1 residual, one variance per heterogeneity variable.
Identification comes from the skewness of the heterogeneity variable, or from
its correlation with the regressors; a symmetric variable uncorrelated with
{it:indepvars} carries no information about the error, and the correction then
abstains.  The idea that the variance of a
classical measurement error can be recovered from higher moments of the data,
with no instrument and no validation sample, is the one that inspired these
conditions: see Erickson and Whited (2002) for the errors-in-variables model
and Ben-Moshe, D'Haultfoeuille and Lewbel (2017) for additive and polynomial
models of a mismeasured regressor.  The conditions used here are not theirs.
Theirs are conditional covariances given the correctly measured regressor,
and require the latent mismeasured regressor to be independent of it once a
conditional mean is removed; these are unconditional moments of a
least-squares residual, one for the constant and one for each regressor,
separable from one heterogeneity variable to the next.

{pmore}
When it activates.  For each heterogeneity variable the command forms
{it:t} = sigma2 / se(sigma2) and corrects only when {it:t} exceeds
{opt tcrit()}, whose default is 2.  Where the correction is not identified,
where the maintained assumptions fail, or where there is no measurement error
at all, the estimated variance goes to zero and the estimator falls back to the
uncorrected {opt het()} fit.  The output names the decision for every variable,
and {cmd:e(merr_s2)}, {cmd:e(merr_t)} and {cmd:e(merr_keep)} hold it.

{pmore}
What it costs.  The correction removes a bias and pays for it in variance.  In
the example below, on a heterogeneity variable whose reliability is 0.52, it
takes an over-statement of 16 per cent down to 0.7 per cent.  In repeated draws
of that design the uncorrected profile was wrong by 14 to 17 per cent every
time while the corrected one moved over -3.5 to +2 per cent; as the reliability
falls the correction stays centred on the truth and its dispersion grows -- at
a reliability of 0.25 the estimated error variance is still right, and the
corrected profile ranges over -11 to +12 per cent.  Report the corrected and
the uncorrected profile together, not the corrected one alone.

{pmore}
What it requires.  The measurement error must be classical: independent of the
regressors, of the true value and of the equation error, with mean zero.  No
distributional assumption is needed for the correction to be VALID, but the
precision of the estimated variance depends on the shape of the heterogeneity
variable, because the identifying moments are third moments.  A skewed variable
correlated with the regressors is the favourable case; a symmetric variable
independent of them carries almost no information about its own error, however
large that error is, and the command abstains rather than guess -- {it:z2} in
the example has a reliability of 0.57 and is left alone.

{pmore}
What the output reports.  Beside {it:sigma2} and its {it:t}, the table gives
for each heterogeneity variable the implied reliability,
1 - {it:sigma2}/Var({it:z~}), the skewness of {it:z~}, and the R-squared of
{it:z~} on the regressors: the two conditions above, one per column, with no
threshold applied to either.  They separate the two reasons a variable can be
left alone.  One that is skewed or correlated with the regressors but whose
{it:t} is small is identifiable and merely not resolved by this sample, and
more data would help.  One whose skewness and R-squared are both near zero
carries no information about its own error, and no sample size ever will.
The reliability says how much work the correction is doing, which is how much
variance it costs.  {cmd:e(merr_diag)} holds the three columns.

{pmore}
What it refuses, and why.  A heterogeneity variable taking two values, an
indicator of a factor variable included.  If {it:z} takes only {it:a} and
{it:b} then {it:z}^2 = ({it:a}+{it:b}) {it:z} - {it:ab}, so the third-moment
conditions are linear combinations of moments that step 1 has already set to
zero: the error variance is not identified at all, and a {it:t} computed from
it is a ratio of two numerical residuals.  Error in a categorical variable is
misclassification in any case, mechanically correlated with the true value,
which is not what is corrected here; the misclassification literature is the
place to look.  The command also refuses a singular step-1 design -- putting
{cmd:i.z} among the regressors while {it:z} is in {opt het()} makes their
interaction proportional to the indicators -- and a corrected moment matrix
that is not positive definite, which is what an error variance too large for
the design produces.  Measurement error in {it:indepvars} themselves is not
covered.  If a heterogeneity variable is also one of the {it:indepvars}, the
command refuses: the error would reach the regressor block as well, and that is
the case where the effect of interest is not defined.

{pmore}
The limit that no check can remove, and the comparison that reads it.  The
identifying moments cannot tell a missing functional form from measurement
error: if the effect is not linear in the heterogeneity variable, the curvature
lands in the step-1 residual and the third moments read it as an error
variance.  On a variable measured EXACTLY whose effect is quadratic, the
command returns an error variance with {it:t} = 11 and moves the profile part
of the way towards what the correctly specified model gives with no correction
at all.

{pmore}
Separating the two cases costs one command.  Fit the enriched model WITHOUT
{opt merr} -- a square, or {cmd:i.} for a categorical code -- and see where it
puts the profile.  If it lands where {opt merr} put it, {opt merr} was doing
the work of the missing term.  If it stays where the uncorrected linear model
was, the correction is doing something no functional form will do.  The two
cases are mirror images: in the quadratic design the corrected profile sits 4
per cent from the enriched one and the uncorrected profile 11 per cent from it;
in the design with real measurement error the distances are the other way
round, 12 and 3.  Do not enrich the model and keep {opt merr} at the same time:
the square of a noisy variable does not carry classical error -- if
{it:z~} = {it:z} + {it:u} then {it:z~}^2 = {it:z}^2 + 2{it:zu} + {it:u}^2,
whose error is correlated with the true value -- and the command refuses it
when it is written with {cmd:#} ({cmd:c.z#c.z}), as does its dialog box.  A
square generated beforehand as a variable ({cmd:generate z2 = z^2}) cannot be
recognised, and would be corrected as though it were measured with an error of
its own: write it with {cmd:#}.  Entering a categorical code as though it were continuous is the usual way
into this trap, which is why such a variable belongs in {cmd:i.} form, where
the correction is refused outright.

{pmore}
Inference.  The influence function accounts for the estimation of the error
variance, so the reported standard errors and the survey-design standard errors
remain valid in the regime where the correction is active.  At the activation
threshold itself the estimator is a pre-test estimator and no standard error is
valid uniformly there; where {it:t} is close to {opt tcrit()}, report the
corrected and uncorrected profiles side by side.  {opt boot(#)} re-runs the
whole procedure, the correction and its threshold included, in every resample.

{opt cband(#)}, {opt band(#)}, {opt silverman}, {opt optbw}: see
{help gepwreg##bandwidth:Bandwidth}.

{dlgtab:Standard errors}

{phang}
{opt vce(svy)} requests the Taylor linearisation under the {helpb svyset}
design; it is automatic when {cmd:svyset} declares a PSU or strata.
{opt vce(if)} keeps the influence-function standard errors on {cmd:svyset}
data.
The Taylor variance sums the scores within PSUs and takes their variance
within strata.  An {cmd:fpc()} declared by {cmd:svyset} is not used: there
is no finite-population correction, and the variance is conservative.  A
stratum with a single PSU in the estimation sample contributes nothing to
it; the output says so.

{phang}
{opt boot(#)} requests the bootstrap with {it:#} replications: pairs of
observations, or PSUs within strata when a design is declared.  The whole
procedure (ranks, step 1, step 2) is re-run at each replication.

{phang}
{opt seed(#)} sets the seed of the bootstrap; the random-number state of
the session is restored afterwards.

{phang}
{opt setable} displays, after the coefficient table, the consistent
standard errors available for the estimation side by side, as the
post-estimation command {cmd:gepwreg_setable} does (a check, not a
choice); the command remains available on its own, for instance after
{cmd:estimates restore}.

{phang}
{opt graph(coefs [, numlist ref uniform])} draws the profile of the effect
across the percentiles of the outcome.  The estimation is run as specified
at {opt percentile()}, displayed as usual and kept in {cmd:e()}, and the
profile at every percentile of {it:numlist} (default 0.05(0.025)0.95, 37
percentiles) is computed inside that one estimation: the step-1 model, the
households' effects and their ranks once, then at each percentile its
bandwidth and the weighted mean.  {it:coefs} names the coefficients to draw,
as they appear in {cmd:e(b)}: {cmd:size}, {cmd:3.gse}, or {cmd:i.gse} for
every level of a factor.  One panel per coefficient, with its pointwise
confidence interval at {opt level()} (dark band) and a dotted line at
{opt percentile()}; the panels are combined into the graph
{cmd:gepwreg_profile}, and the profile is stored in {cmd:e(profile)}.

{pmore}
The intervals: under {opt het(varlist)} the influence function, computed at
every percentile from the same households, gives the joint covariance of the
whole profile (Taylor under a design).  Under {opt het(qr)} they need
{opt boot(#)}, and ONE loop of draws serves every percentile: in each draw
the whole procedure is re-estimated -- the grid of quantile regressions, the
ranks, the reference household, and at each percentile its bandwidth and
{it:q_tau} -- so that the draws of the profile are those of the curve, not
of each point apart.  At every percentile the standard error is exactly that
of a separate estimation with the same seed, and the table at
{opt percentile()} takes the same draws.

{pmore}
{opt uniform} adds the simultaneous band (light): the band that covers the
whole profile with probability {opt level()}, b -/+ c se, c the
{opt level()} quantile of max over the percentiles of |b* - b| / se (from
the joint normal of the influence functions under {opt het(varlist)}, from
the draws under {opt het(qr)}).  {opt ref} adds the curve of the reference
household of {opt ref()} ({cmd:ref(default)} if the command gives none),
dashed, with its interval dotted; under {opt het(varlist)} it is flat by
construction; under {opt het(qr)}, where the reference household would need a
conditional rank outside the grid of quantile regressions to reach
{it:q_tau}, its curve is held at the end of the grid, and a note under the
figure says at which percentiles.  Under the title of each panel, {it:p} is
the test that the effect is constant across the percentiles of the figure: the largest
standardised deviation of the profile from its own mean, against its
distribution under the null (sup-t, the joint distribution); it is given
for the reference curve too under {opt het(qr)} with {opt boot(#)}.  With
{opt initial()}, {opt merr}, {opt rankvar()} or {opt rankdep}, the estimation
is re-run at every percentile and the figure shows the pointwise intervals
only.

{phang}
{opt level(#)} sets the confidence level of the table.

{phang}
{opt noconstant} suppresses the constant of the weighted regression
({opt rankvar}, {opt rankdep}); step 1 of the two-step keeps its constant.

the weighted mean of {it:z_l} in the group, which has a direct term,
{it:n fw_i w_i (z_il - zbar_l) / S}, and a rank term from the estimated
percentile ranks inside the weights, computed by a reverse cumulative sum
over the units above {it:i} as in Deville (1999).  {cmd:e(V_IF)} is
psi'psi / n^2 with centred scores; under a survey design {cmd:e(V)} is the
Taylor variance of the same scores over PSUs within strata.  The three

{ul:Ties in the ranking variable.}  Every observation of a tie group receives

depend on the order of the observations.  The rank term of the influence
function is summed over the SET of units whose rank is at least that of
{it:i}, not over the rows below it in the sorted data, so the standard errors
do not either.  Up to version 1.3 that sum was positional and the reported
standard errors moved when the data were permuted -- by 8e-04 on a ranking
variable with seven distinct values over 8,478 observations, by 7e-07 on a
continuous one.  The estimates themselves were never affected.

{title:Bandwidth}

{pstd}
The kernel is on the percentile scale, and since 1.4 the MSE-optimal
plug-in is the default for every estimator.  {opt silverman} reverts to
{it:h} = {it:cband} x min(sd(p), IQR(p)/1.34) x {it:n}^(-1/5) and
{opt band(#)} fixes {it:h} by hand.

{pstd}
In the two-step, step 2 is a Nadaraya-Watson average of the unit-level
effects along the rank of {it:y}.  That rank is uniform by construction, so
the design-density term of the local constant bias vanishes and
MSE_j({it:h}) = {it:h}^4 theta_j''(tau)^2 + s_j^2 / (2 sqrt(2 pi) {it:n h}),
with s_j^2 = Var(b_ij | p_i = tau).  The coefficients do not share units, so
what is minimised is the average {it:relative} MSE and one bandwidth serves
the whole call:

{pmore}
{it:h*} = [ {it:k} / (8 sqrt(2 pi) {it:n} sum_j (theta_j'' / s_j)^2 ) ]^(1/5),

{pstd}
clipped to [0.5, 3] x {it:h_Silverman}.  The pilot is at
2 x {it:h_Silverman}, with a second difference of step
min(0.05, {it:tau}/2, (1-{it:tau})/2).  It is cheap: the unit-level effects
do not depend on {it:h}, so the pilot costs three weighted means and no
refitting.

{pstd}
For {opt rankvar} and {opt rankdep} the plug-in of Araar (2026) applies to
the local mean of the ranking variable: pilot 2 x {it:h_Silverman},
curvature at {it:tau} +/- 0.02, {it:h*} clipped to
[0.3, 5] x {it:h_Silverman}.

{pstd}
On simulations at {it:n} = 2,000 to 20,000 the two-step plug-in sits on
average 13 percent above the root mean squared error of the best possible
bandwidth, against 33 percent for the Silverman rule, with a worst case of
52 percent against 216.  It is least reliable at {it:tau} close to 0 or 1
when the profile of the effect is strongly curved there, because the pilot's
second difference then reads the profile where the kernel is cut by the
boundary of the rank; {opt silverman} is the fallback in that case.
{cmd:e(N_eff)} is the effective size of the group; values below 50 suggest a
bandwidth too narrow for the sample.

{pstd}
{bf:One warning about the standard errors.}  The influence-function variance
is derived with the bandwidth held fixed, and a bandwidth chosen on the
sample adds a term it cannot contain: the estimate inherits the variability
of the choice.  The term is negligible wherever the bandwidth does not matter
much, which is most of the range, and material where the MSE curve is steep
-- at {it:tau} near 0 or 1 with a curved profile.  On simulations at
{it:n} = 4,000 it is worth 23 percent of the standard deviation at
{it:tau} = 0.9, 4 percent at 0.5 and nothing at 0.1, and the coverage of the
nominal 95 percent interval falls to 0.82 in the first case.  {opt boot(#)}
re-chooses the bandwidth in every resample and prices it correctly (ratio to
the Monte Carlo dispersion 1.05, 0.99, 1.03 at the three quantiles), so use
it near the tails or whenever {cmd:e(h)} comes back near 3 x {it:h_Silverman}
or 0.5 x {it:h_Silverman}.  {opt silverman} and {opt band(#)} make the
bandwidth deterministic and restore the analytical variance exactly.

The true error variances are 0.25 and 0.0625, and the true effect at
{it:tau} = 0.75 is 2.976.  The first run is the oracle, on the heterogeneity
variables themselves, and returns 2.963.  The second, on the proxies, returns
3.453 -- over-stated by 16 per cent.  The third estimates 0.2491 for the first
error variance, with {it:t} = 19, and abstains on the second, whose {it:t} is
1.3: {it:z2} is symmetric and independent of {it:x}, so its error is not
identified however large it is, and here its reliability is 0.57.  The
corrected effect is 2.956, within 0.7 per cent of the truth.{p_end}

{pstd}
Before reporting any corrected profile, run the comparison of the previous
section, the last command of the example: the enriched model without
{opt merr}.  Here it returns 3.345, close to the uncorrected 3.453 and far from
the corrected 2.956 -- enriching the model does not do what the correction
does, which is the sign that the correction is answering measurement error and
not a missing term.{p_end}

Under {opt het(varlist)} the effect of a household depends only on its values
of the {opt het()} variables -- here its location and its size -- and not on
its rank in the distribution.  The effect at {it:tau} is then the effect of
the mean household of the group at {it:q_tau}: the profile follows the
location and the size of the households along the distribution, and nothing
else.  The dashed curve is the mean household of the population
({cmd:ref(mean)}); it is flat, and under this model it is also the average
effect in the population.  For {cmd:size}: -0.078 (s.e. 0.003) on average;
-0.061 at the first quartile, where the households are larger and more often
rural (9.5 members and 8 per cent urban, against 7.6 and 23 per cent in the
population: the composition table); -0.115 at the 95th percentile.  Under the
title of each panel, {it:p} tests that the profile is constant: 0.000 for
size and for crop farmers, 0.118 for the male head and 0.592 for the urban
premium.  A small {it:p} says here that the composition matters for the
effect, not that the effect of a given household changes with its rank: that
is the question of example 9.{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:Example 9.} The profile for a given household: is the effect
constant along the distribution?  The same regression under {opt het(qr)},
the default model: the effect of a household is the slope of the conditional
quantile regressions at its own conditional rank, so the profile mixes the
composition of the group and the rank of its households.
{cmd:ref(default)} follows a given household along the distribution, a real
type -- the mean size, a male head, rural, a subsistence farmer: at each
percentile, its effect at the conditional rank at which it reaches
{it:q_tau}.  {cmd:boot(50)} re-estimates the whole profile in each
draw{p_end}

{pstd}
At {it:tau} = 0.25 the reference household is at the conditional rank 0.298,
and its effects are close to those of the group.  Along the distribution, the
test that the effect is constant gives {it:p} = 0.67 for the group and 0.77
for the reference household for {cmd:size}, 0.20 and 0.26 for the male head,
0.16 and 0.26 for the urban premium: no evidence that these effects change
along the distribution, for the group or for the given household.  The gap of
crop farmers with the base
category widens from -0.84 at the 5th percentile to -1.09 at the 95th,
with {it:p} = 0.039 for the group and 0.059 for the reference household:
weak evidence at most, since with 50 draws a {it:p} moves by steps of 1/51
= 0.02.  Where this household would need a conditional rank beyond the last
quantile regression of the grid (0.95) to reach {it:q_tau}, its curve is
held at that quantile: the flat end of the dashed curve, from {it:tau} = 0.825,
as the note under the figure says.  Fifty
draws are a demonstration, which runs in under two minutes; the band and the
{it:p}-values rest on the tail of the draws, so use {cmd:boot(200)} or more
for inference.{p_end}

{pstd}
The two examples do not contradict each other on {cmd:size}, where the first
finds a profile and the second none: each profile says what its model lets
the effect depend on.  {opt het(urban size)} lets the effect of size depend
on the size and the location of the household, which change along the
distribution; the quantile regressions of {opt het(qr)} are linear in size at
every quantile, and let its effect depend on the conditional rank only, along
which it is flat.{p_end}

frozen as the branch {cmd:v15} with version 5 of the paper and its
replication.

{pmore}
{ul:The effect for a given household.}  The profile of the effect across
{it:tau} mixes the composition of the group at {it:tau} with the
heterogeneity of the effect.  {opt ref(default | mean | var=# ...)} reports
the effect for a reference household, which holds the composition fixed:
a real type by default, the mean household, or values given.  Under
{opt het(varlist)} its effect does not depend on {it:tau}, so the whole
profile is composition, and it has the exact influence function; under
{opt het(qr)} it is the slope of the conditional quantile regression at the
conditional rank at which the household reaches {it:q_tau}
({cmd:e(u_ref)}), with the bootstrap, or a delta-method standard error
reported with a warning.  {cmd:e(b_ref)}, {cmd:e(V_ref)}, {cmd:e(ref_x)}.

{pmore}
{ul:The profile across percentiles.}  {opt graph()} draws the profile of the
named coefficients, computed inside one estimation: under
{opt het(varlist)} the joint influence function of the whole profile
(Taylor under a design), under {opt het(qr)} one loop of bootstrap draws for
every percentile, each draw re-estimating the whole procedure.  Keywords
{opt uniform} (the simultaneous band) and {opt ref} (the reference
household's curve, with a note where it is held at an end of the quantile
grid); under each panel, the test that the effect is constant across the
percentiles.  {cmd:e(profile)}, {cmd:e(prof_*)}.

{pmore}
{ul:Corrections.}  A binary regressor that is also a heterogeneity variable
gets the 1-vs-0 difference of its effect, not the derivative of x^2 = x,
which the data do not identify; only that configuration changes.
{opt merr} refuses a function of the heterogeneity variables (an interaction
or a power written with {cmd:#}), in the command and in the dialog box.
Frequency weights are refused (they were treated as sampling weights); the
bootstrap under a design is labelled as such; notes on {opt fpc()} and on
strata with a single PSU; new {cmd:e(vce)}, {cmd:e(initial)},
{cmd:e(ranklabel)}, {cmd:e(title)}.

{pmore}
{ul:Speed.}  The quantile regressions of {opt het(qr)} run on qreg's own
solver path without the variance that gepwreg does not use: the same
coefficients, about four times faster.

{pmore}
{ul:Help and dialog box.}  Every example runs from its links -- in the
command window, in the dialog box filled in (one link per estimation), or as
a do-file ({cmd:gepwreg_examples}); examples 8 and 9 draw the profile against
the mean household and for a given household.  The dialog box offers
{opt ref()} and the keywords of {opt graph()}.

{phang}
1.4 (September 2026): {it:place} {cmd:v14}, with the previous versions of the
paper and their replication.  One release since 1.3; the version numbers in
between were development states and were never distributed.

{pmore}
{ul:The estimator.}  The effect at the {it:tau}-quantile of the outcome is
estimated by a two-step estimator ({opt het(qr)} by default,
{opt het(varlist)}): unit-level effects from a heterogeneity model fitted on
the whole sample, averaged with the percentile weights on the rank of the
outcome.  The kernel-weighted regression on outcome-ranked units of 1.3
converges to a bandwidth-dependent fraction of the effect as soon as the
outcome has an error term; it is kept as {opt rankdep} and labelled
descriptive.  New: {opt initial()} and {opt xref()} for the effect at the
initial quantile, {opt qgrid()}.  {opt rankvar()} is unchanged and now says
why it refuses several variables or a factor-variable term.

{pmore}
{ul:Bandwidth.}  The MSE-optimal plug-in is the default for every estimator,
the second step of the two-step included; {opt silverman} and {opt band()}
override it.

{pmore}
{ul:Measurement error.}  {opt merr} corrects the step-1 fit of
{opt het(}{it:varlist}{opt )} for classical measurement error, one variance
per variable, identified from the third moments of the step-1 residual and
applied only where {it:t} exceeds {opt tcrit()}; the influence function
accounts for the estimated variance, and {opt boot()} redoes the correction
and its threshold in every resample.  The command refuses what it cannot
identify: a heterogeneity variable with two values, a singular step-1 design,
a corrected moment matrix that is not positive definite.  The table reports
the implied reliability, the skewness and the R-squared on the regressors per
variable, in {cmd:e(merr_diag)}.

{pmore}
{ul:Standard errors.}  Taylor linearisation by default under {cmd:svyset}
({opt vce(if)} keeps the IF standard errors), {cmd:e(V_IF)} always stored,
and a bootstrap that re-runs the whole procedure.  The scores of
{opt rankvar} and {opt rankdep} are centred -- the constant of the indirect
term was omitted up to 1.3, a difference of second order.  Standard errors no
longer depend on the order of the observations: the rank term is summed over
the set of units above {it:i} rather than over the rows below it, which the
estimates never needed and the variances did.

{pmore}
{ul:Weights.}  One rule, stated in the header: {cmd:svyset} first, the command
line only when {cmd:svyset} declares none; {cmd:e(wtype)}, {cmd:e(wexp)} and
{cmd:e(wsrc)} record the choice.

{pmore}
{ul:Also.}  Factor variables: every non-base level gets its own indicator, where
up to 1.3 the second level was pooled with the base.  A PSU count per stratum.
{cmd:gepwreg_setable} in its own file and as the {opt setable} option.  A
rewritten dialog box covering every option.  Progress dots on every bootstrap
path, with {opt nodots}.  Execution time in the header and in {cmd:e(etime)}.

{phang}
1.3 (June 2026): {it:place} {cmd:v13}.  MSE-optimal bandwidth as the default, Taylor linearisation
under {cmd:svyset}, ties in the ranking variable given the same rank,
{cmd:rankvar()}.
